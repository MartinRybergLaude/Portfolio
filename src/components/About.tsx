                    My name is Martin, and Iâ€™m an android & web developer from Stockholm, Sweden. I create quick and intuitive apps and websites with the goal of being beautiful, simple to use and consistent. I believe a recognisable and consistent experience to be the most important factor in user experience, both from brand and platform perspectives. This, combined with quality code, accessibility in mind, and well planned features, provides the base for all my development, and will always do.

                <p className={styles.text}>
                    Outside of development my interests include boating, music production and a little photography. It should therefore not be a surprise that I'd describe myself as a person on the creative side of the spectrum, which most of my hobbies and work relate to. Additionally, I have a strong curiousity and passion for learning about new technologies. The future has grand things in store!
